SDLPAL is an SDL-based reimplementation of the classic Chinese-language RPG

This program does NOT include any code or data files of the original game,
which is proprietary and copyrighted by SoftStar Inc.


COMPILE UNDER WINDOWS
=====================

The following compilers/IDEs are supported under Windows:

1) Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 or higher
2) Dev-C++ 4.9.9.2
3) Open Watcom 1.7

To compile, open the respective project file (sdlpal.sln, sdlpal.dev, or
sdlpal.wpj). You need to have SDL development files installed.


COMPILE UNDER GNU/LINUX
=======================

To compile, type:

make

You need to have SDL development files installed. The compiled executable
should be generated with the filename 'sdlpal' at the top directory of source
files.

SDLPAL should also be able to run under other UNIX-like systems, however
it's not tested.


COMPILE UNDER MAC OS X
======================

To compile, open the project Pal.xcodeproj with Xcode, and click Build. You
need to have SDL framework installed at /Library/Frameworks.

The compiled bundle should work as a "universal" binary which works on both
Intel and PowerPC.


CLASSIC BUILD
=============

By default, SDLPAL uses a revised battle system which is more exciting yet
somewhat harder than the original game. If you prefer the traditional
turn-based battle system, uncomment the following line:

//#define PAL_CLASSIC           1

in the file common.h and recompile. This will build a "classic" build which is
100% the same as the original game.


RUNNING THE GAME
================

The data files required for running the game are not included with the source
package due to copyright issues. You must obtain them from the original CD.

To run the game, copy all the files on the original CD to a directory, then
copy the SDLPAL executable to the same directory, and run the executable.

Note that the filenames of data files should be in lower-case under GNU/Linux
(or other UNIX-like operating systems).
